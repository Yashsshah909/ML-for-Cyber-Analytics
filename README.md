# ML-for-Cyber-Analytics

Hi. 
In this repo, I have tackled a specific problem in the CIC IDS datasets for ml. There are a lot of fancy implementations of ML classification and deep learning algos out there for this and similar datasets, but none of them specifically consider some of the caetgorical features that it has. 
Hence I have looked at some of the categorical features in this and tried to use it for an ML model.

The dataset used in this is - IDS CIC 2017 dataset - https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html. This link has a detailed explanation of what this dataset contains.
